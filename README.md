# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Resources
- Software: SQL, 
- PostgreSQL, 
- pgAdmin

## Overview of Project
Conducted a detailed database analysis for Pewlett Hackard on the number of retiring employees per position title and department. The purpose of this analysis was to create a new hire plan to offset the number of retiring employees. We also prepared a database to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.


## Results
- An ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was created in order to visualize the relationships between the data sources provided and the structure needed to produce the analysis (see below).
